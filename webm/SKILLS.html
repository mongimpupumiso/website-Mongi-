            <h2>MY SKILLS AND TALENTS</h2>

            <p>
                Naturally I was born an athlete, there's nothing pertaining sports that I can do.
                That is where my skills and talent are. I used to play for Braamfischer Eagles in the
                castle league, when it comes atletics in the races I've ran I only have silver and gold
                my trophy collections. Resently I just started weight lifting and doing well too.
                There last thing I need to focus on to take all my skills and talents that I have and put it to
                programming and achieve something too.
