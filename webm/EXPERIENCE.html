                My journey in a work environment. I started at Black Rock Casino, at New Castle at Kwazulu Natal.
                I worked there for three years, by then I was still a trainee dealer from training school at
                Kent avenue Casino training school.After tree years I missed Soweto because that is where I grew up,
                So I applied at Carnival City Casino as an experience dealer and worked there for five making it eight 
                years in the casino industry.I left there in 2018, because I wanted to go back to school and still things 
                did not go as planned. And one of my friends gave me a post where they wantend people who had matric to 
                do software development.And more information I found out about it, I started goolgling more palces 
                where I can pursue software development for free and thats how I found out about Umuzi my.
                And that's how I self in this beautiful place.
